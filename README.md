### Android app to create secure password from phrases

Passwy is a simple open sourced Password-Generator app for Android. It doesn't have any useless features or other things that may be bad for your privacy.

Passwy turns any entered phrase into a strong password between 4 and 64 characters long and also gives you the possibility to copy it to the system clipboard. You can use it as a decent system that will allow unique passphrases for every website, such as combining the name or the URL of a website with a phrase that you wouldn't forget.

You are strongly advised to use phrases that are very unique to you. This can be done through including keywords like email addresses, your cat's name or maybe the name of your city. This ensures that your generated password is unique for you.
